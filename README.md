# Google Clone

## Description
This project is a clone of the Google search interface. It includes the main search page, an image search page, and an advanced search page. This clone attempts to replicate the look and feel of Google's search pages, including the layout and styling of the search forms and buttons.

## Features
- **Main Search Page**: Mimics the Google homepage with a search box and two buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky."
- **Image Search Page**: A simplified version of Google Images search, with functionality to search for images.
- **Advanced Search Page**: Provides additional search criteria to refine search queries, similar to Google's own advanced search options.
